This linear RBFNN has both good localization approximation and linear computation complexity with the number of dimension and number of inputs. Its performance is comparable with support vector machine (SVM) for tasks of pattern recognition with a rapider speed. We applied it to the identification of target profile in UWB radar, which needs excessively fast processing. The experimental results are achieved including higher recognition rate and shorter consumed time, which is superior to its counterparts.",2005

This test estimates the mean square error (MSE) that can be achieved without overfitting. The best set of inputs is the one that minimises the result of the Gamma test. The second method estimates the Mutual Information between a set of inputs and the output. The best set of inputs is the one that maximises the Mutual Information.

The idea is to exploit a new distance metric called the ""Euclidian Commute Time"" (ECT) distance, based on a random walk model on a graph derived from the data. Using this distance measure instead of the usual Euclidean distance in a k-means algorithm allows to retrieve wellseparated clusters of arbitrary shape, without working hypothesis about their data distribution.

Our knowledge of the mechanisms of natural perception suggests that, when the recognition process fails due to the degradation of the observation conditions and to the blurring of the intrinsic attributes of the objects, the information concerning the context is used by human for object recognition priming. In this case the indices used for object identification can be greatly simplified. We present in this paper an attempt to precise how such a principle can be applied to autonomous robotics.

Initially, we determine the candidate set which consists of the features that do not deteriorate the generalization ability, if each is deleted from the initial set of features. If the generalization ability is not deteriorated even if all the candidate features are deleted, we terminate the algorithm. Otherwise, we delete by backward deletion the candidate feature that improves the generalization ability the most, and determine the candidate set that is a subset of the current candidate set.

This procedure is benefitial for data in euclidean space and it is crucial for more complex data structures such as occur in bioinformatics or natural language processing. In this article, we review similarity based methods and its combination with similarity measures which go beyond the standard Euclidian metric. Thereby, we focus on general unifying principles of learning using non-standard metrics and metric adaptation.",2005

This consideration leads to a model that is formulated as a stochastic differential equation. In the stochastic setting, the analysis reveals that the model is stable, and the states converge towards an attractive set, assuming the noise intensity is bounded.

2 - Manufacturing Technology Division Heroon Polytehneiou 9, 157 80 Zografou Athens Greece","Any feedforward artificial neural network (ANN) training procedure begins with the initialisation of the connection weights' values. These initial values are generally selected in a random or quasi-random way in order to increase training speed. Nevertheless, it is common practice to initialize the same ANN architecture in a repetitive way in order for satisfactory training results to be achieved. This is due to the fact that the error function may have many local extrema and the training algorithm can get trapped in any one of them depending on its starting point based on the particular initialisation of weights. This paper proposes a systematic way for weight initialisation that is based on performing multiple linear regression on the training data. Experimental data from a metal cutting process were used for ANN model building to demonstrate an improvement on both training speed and achieved training error regardless of the selected architecture.",2005

To tackle this problem, practitioners have often recourse to a search procedure in a very large space of subsets of features aiming to minimize a leave-one-out or more in general a cross-validation criterion. It has been previously discussed in literature, how this practice can lead to a strong bias selection in the case of high dimensionality problems. We propose here an alternative method, inspired by structural identification in model selection, which replaces a single global search by a number of searches into a sequence of nested spaces of features with an increasing number of variables. The paper presents some promising, although preliminary results on several real nonlinear regression problems.",2005

Intra-modular synapses are trained auto-associatively with a Hebb rule, while a set of inter-module synapses are hetero-associative.

An adequate connectivity is a requisite for synaptogenesis and the development of synchronous oscillatory network activity during maturation of cortical networks. In a defined time window early in development neurites have to grow out and connect to other neurons. Based on morphological observations we postulate that the underlying mechanism differs from common strategies of unspecific global or small world strategies. We show here that a displaced local connection mode is a very effective approach to connect neurons with minimal costs. * Supported by the federal state of Saxony-Anhalt FKZ Xn3590C/0305M.,2006

When using nonlinear Mercer kernels, the mapping of the input space to a highdimensional feature space makes the input feature selection a difficult task to be addressed. In this paper, we propose the use of nonparametric bootstrap resampling technique to provide with a statistical, distribution independent, criterion for input space feature selection. The confidence interval of the difference of error probability between the complete input space and a reduced-in-one-variable input space, is estimated via bootstrap resampling. Hence, a backward variable elimination procedure can be stated, by removing one variable at each step according to its associated confidence interval. A practical example application to early stage detection of cardiac Ventricular Fibrillation (VF) is presented. Basing on a previous nonlinear analysis based on temporal and spectral VF parameters, we use the SVM with Gaussian kernel and bootstrap resampling to provide with the minimum input space feature set that still holds the classification performance of the complete data. The use of bootstrap resampling is a powerful input feature selection procedure for SVM classifiers. * This work has been partially supported by research projects from Guidant Spain and from ""Comunidad de Madrid"" (GR/SAL/0471/2004).",2006

2 - Université Paris-Sud 91405 Orsay Cedex France","We present experimental results about learning function values (i.e. Bellman values) in stochastic dynamic programming (SDP). All results come from openDP (opendp.sourceforge.net), a freely available source code, and therefore can be reproduced. The goal is an independent comparison of learning methods in the framework of SDP. 
 What is stochastic dynamic programming (SDP) ? We here very roughly introduce stochastic dynamic programming. The interested reader is referred to [1] for more details. Consider a dynamical system that stochastically evolves in time depending upon your decisions. Assume that time is discrete and has finitely many time steps. Assume that the total cost of your decisions is the sum of instantaneous costs. Precisely: where x i is the state at time step i, the ω i are a random process, cost is to be minimized, and strategy is the decision function that has to be optimized. Stochastic dynamic programming is a control problem : the element to be optimized is a function. Stochastic dynamic programming is based on the following principle : Take the decision at time step t such that the sum ""cost at time step t due to your decision"" plus ""expected cost from time steps t + 1 to T from the state resulting from your decision"" is minimal. Bellman's optimality principle states that this strategy is optimal. Unfortunately, it can only be applied if the expected cost from time steps t+1 to T can be guessed, depending on the current state of the system and the decision. Bellman's optimality principle reduces the control problem to the computation of this function. If x t can be computed from x t−1 and d t−1 (i.e., if f is known) then this is reduced to the computation of Note that this function depends on the strategy. We consider this expectation for any optimal strategy (even if many strategies are optimal, V is uniquely determined). Stochastic dynamic programming is the computation of V backwards in time, thanks to the following equation : (main equation) Thanks to Bellman's optimality principle, the computation of V is sufficient to define an optimal strategy by d i−1 = argmin c i−1 + V (i, x i ) =",2006

To insure these properties, we propose a hierarchical model for the sources with a common hidden classification variable which is modelled via a Potts-Markov field. The joint Bayesian estimation of this hidden variable as well as the sources and the mixing matrix of the BSS problem gives a solution for all the three problems of spectra classification, segmentation and data reduction problems of hyperspectral images.

Box 5400 FI-02015 Finland,"In this paper, an improvement to the E step of the EM algorithm for nonlinear state-space models is presented. We also propose strategies for model structure selection when the EM-algorithm and statespace models are used for time series prediction. Experiments on the Poland electricity load time series show that the method gives good shortterm predictions and can also be used for long-term prediction. 
 Introduction Time series prediction is an important problem in many fields. Applications include finance, prediction of electricity load and ecology. Time series prediction is a problem of system identification. Taken's theorem  [1]  ensures that if the dynamic of an underlying system is deterministic, a regression approach can be used for prediction. However, many real world phenomena are stochastic and more complicated methods might be necessary. One possibility is to use a state-space model for predicting the behavior of a time series. This kind of model is very general and is able to model many kinds of phenomena. Choosing the structure and estimating the parameters of a state-space model can be done in many ways. One approach is to use the EM-algorithm and Radial Basis Functions (RBF)-networks  [2] . The main problem is that the E-step of the algorithm is difficult due to nonlinearity of the model. In this paper, we apply a Gaussian filter which handles nonlinearities better than the ordinary Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) which is used in  [2] . The problem of choosing the dimension of the state-space and the number of neurons is also investigated. This problem is important as too complicated a model can lead to numerical instability, high computational complexity and overfitting. We propose the use of training error curves for model structure selection. The experimental results show that the method works well in practice. We also show that the EM-algorithm maximizes the short-term prediction performance but is not optimal for long-term prediction.",2006

In many applications, the data are in a high dimensional space. This can be problematic in practice due to the curse of dimensionality. Fortunately, the core of the data lies often on one or several low-dimensional manifolds. A way to handle these is to pre-process the data by nonlinear data projection techniques. Another approach is to combine local linear models. In particular, mixtures of probabilistic principal component analyzers are very attractive as each component is specifically designed to extract the local principal orientations in the data. However, an important issue is the model sensitivity to data lying off the manifold, possibly leading to mismatches between successive local models. The mixtures of robust probabilistic principal component analyzers introduced in this paper heal this problem as each component is able to cope with atypical data while identifying the local principal directions.

2 - Universität Karlsruhe (TH) -Institute for Algorithms and Cognitive Systems 76128 Karlsruhe Germany","We propose a method to evaluate the complexity of probability measures from data that is based on a reproducing kernel Hilbert space seminorm of the logarithm of conditional probability densities. The motivation is to provide a tool for a causal inference method which assumes that conditional probabilities for effects given their causes are typically simpler and smoother than vice-versa. We present experiments with toy data where the quantitative results are consistent with our intuitive understanding of complexity and smoothness. Also in some examples with real-world data the probability measure corresponding to the true causal direction turned out to be less complex than those of the reversed order. 
 Introduction First, let us sketch the basic idea of our causal inference rule. Given a joint distribution on n variables, all the conditional distributions that appear in the factorization of the joint measure P (x 1 ,. . ., x n ) = P (x 1 )P (x 2 |x 1 ) . . . P (x n |x 1 ,. . . ,x n−1 ) will typically be smoother if the order of the factorization X 1 , . . . , X n coincides with the causal order, in the sense that there is no pair (X i , X j ) with i < j such that X j is a cause of X i . In some cases, this approach could be very useful, in particular where the conventional constraint-based inference rules (e.g. [1, 2]) fail. In particular, our inference rule can provide some hints about causal direction between only two observed variables 1 (see [3]) where constraint-based approaches are not capable. How to quantify smoothness and simplicity of a conditional distribution concerning causal asymmetry is herewith of vital importance. In this paper, we propose to measure the complexity of a distribution by a seminorm of the function which describes the logarithm of the probability distribution. The function is an element of a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) and its seminorm can be computed by usual kernel methods. In contrast to common machine learning applications, the complexity measure here plays not only the role of a regularizer to avoid the overfitting of finite data. It is rather considered as an interesting quantity in its own right since it should provide hints on the causal direction. For this purpose, it is important to chose a definition of complexity which is well-behaved in some respects. 1 It is to mention that we do not intend to treat the problem of confounding on assessing causality in the current paper and assume there are no hidden common causes in our setup.",2007

In the past, learning has proven a viable alternative to using a combination of rigid-body dynamics and handcrafted approximations of nonlinearities. However, a major open question is what nonparametric learning method is suited best for learning dynamics? Traditionally, locally weighted projection regression (LWPR), has been the standard method as it is capable of online, real-time learning for very complex robots. However, while LWPR has had significant impact on learning in robotics, alternative nonparametric regression methods such as support vector regression (SVR) and Gaussian processes regression (GPR) offer interesting alternatives with fewer open parameters and potentially higher accuracy. In this paper, we evaluate these three alternatives for model learning. Our comparison consists out of the evaluation of learning quality for each regression method using original data from SARCOS robot arm, as well as the robot tracking performance employing learned models.

Furthermore it is unclear how consistently particular methods can achieve good results. Here we use a set of robotic motion data for which we know the ground truth to evaluate a range of nonlinear dimensionality reduction methods with respect to the quality of motion interpolation.

Recently the computation of the mutual information for regression tasks has been proposed so this paper presents a new application of the concept of mutual information not to select the variables but to decide which prototypes should belong to the training data set in regression problems. The proposed methodology consists in deciding if a prototype should belong or not to the training set using as criteria the estimation of the mutual information between the variables. The novelty of the approach is to focus in prototype selection for regression problems instead of classification as the majority of the literature deals only with the last one.

A new paradigm for learning is needed for neural nets being such autonomously active, since standard Hebbian-style online learning would result in uncontrolled reinforcement of accidental activity patterns. Here we propose that autonomously active neural networks processing a time series of stimuli adapt whenever a stimulus successfully influences the ongoing internal dynamics. In this case the incoming stimulus corresponds to a novel signal. We then show, that the network performance results in an unsupervised non-linear independent component analysis of the input data stream. We propose this paradigm to be of relevance for stimulus processing in both natural and artificial neural nets.",2009

We study the relationship between resonant properties of neurons and network oscillations in a computational model of neocortex.

To compensate for this, most courting males construct the vertical mud structures, called semidomes, at the entrance of their burrows and use them as landmarks. Here, we suggest a possible neural model that demonstrates how visual landmark navigation could be implemented in the fiddler crab's central nervous system.

The architecture is designed to model the minimal relevant dynamics of an environment, capable of condensing large sets of continuous observables to a compact state representation and excluding irrelevant information. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first approach published to automatically extract minimal relevant aspects of the dynamics from observations to model a Markov decision process, suitable for RL, without requiring special knowledge of the regarded environment. The capabilities of the neural state estimation approach are evaluated using the cart-pole problem and standard table-based policy iteration.",2010

Existing state-of-the-art methods dealing with this problem are either exact but slow, or fast but very approximative and unreliable. We propose a method based on Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) to approximate solutions both effectively and accurately. The original PSO algorithm is modified so as to search for optimal solutions over the rotation group SO(3). Particles are defined as 3D rotation matrices and operations are expressed over SO(3) using matrix products, exponentials and logarithms. The symmetry of the problem is also exploited. Numerical experiments show that the proposed algorithm outperforms existing methods, often by far. * This paper presents research results of the Belgian Network DYSCO (Dynamical Systems, Control, and Optimization, funded by the Interuniversity Attraction Poles Programme, initiated by the Belgian State, Science Policy Office).

Detailed simulations carried out for the software model of such network show that the triangular function forms a good approximation of the Gaussian function, while being implemented in a much easier way in hardware. The proposed circuit is very flexible and allows for easy adjustments of the slope of the function. It enables the asynchronous and fully parallel operation of all neurons in the network thus making it very fast. The proposed mechanism can be used in custom designed networks either in their analog or digital implementation. Due to the simple structure, the energy consumption per a single input pattern is low (120 pJ in case of the map of 16 x 16 neurons).",2010

When the map is effective (i.e. when short distances are preserved) it is a powerful way to help an analyst to understand the data set. But, mappings most often show defaults and the user is then led astray. According to this notion, a mapping should not be considered when its overall quality is not good enough. Many imperfect mappings can however be exploited by informing the user of the nature and level of defaults. In this work, we propose to visualize local indices trustworthiness and continuity for that purpose. 
 Mappings When dealing with high-dimensional data the capacity to visualize the ""spatial organization"" is a powerful way to help an analyst to understand the data set. Its use provides a critical benefit for extracting information or can (for example) lead the user to the most suitable analysis method. This point is the main purpose of dimensionality reduction methods (also called mapping methods). Especially, Multi Dimensional Scaling (MDS) is the set of methods (including  [2, 3, 7, 8, 10] ) designed to embed data in a low-dimensional Euclidean space (the so called ""output space"") while preserving ""maximally"" the distances observed between data in the original space with a special attention to short distances. A main difference between methods can be found in the mean used to quantify the level of interest of each distance (that is to say, how much a given distance can be considered as ""short""). Using dimensionality reduction on a given dataset involves an underlying hypothesis: it assumes that data lies on (or close to) a low-dimensional submanifold of the original space. Following this line, the dimensionality of such a manifold is named ""intrinsic dimension"" of the dataset and should be chosen as the dimension of the output space. To limit the distortions Multidimensional scaling method unfolds the submanifold and delivers it on the output space.",2010

Many of these data sets are very complex but have also a simple inherent structure which allows an appropriate sparse representation and modeling of such data with less or no information loss. Advanced methods are needed to extract these inherent but hidden information. Sparsity can be observed at different levels: sparse representation of data points using e.g. dimensionality reduction for efficient data storage, sparse representation of full data sets using e.g. prototypes to achieve compact models for lifelong learning and sparse models of the underlying data structure using sparse encoding techniques. One main goal is to achieve a human-interpretable representation of the essential information. Sparse representations account for the ubiquitous problem that humans have to deal with ever increasing and inherently unlimited information by means of limited resources such as limited time, memory, or perception abilities. Starting with the seminal paper of Olshausen&Field  [40]  researchers recognized that sparsity can be used as a fundamental principle to arrive at very efficient information processing models for huge and complex data such as observed e.g. in the visual cortex. Nowadays, sparse models include diverse methods such as relevance learning in prototype based representations, sparse coding neural gas, factor analysis methods, latent semantic indexing, sparse Bayesian networks, relevance vector machines and other.

Original GTM is restricted to Euclidean data points in a vector space. Often, data are not explicitly embedded in a Euclidean vector space, rather pairwise dissimilarities of data can be computed, i.e. the relations between data points are given rather than the data vectors themselves. We propose a method which extends the GTM to relational data and which allows to achieve a sparse representation of data characterized by pairwise dissimilarities, in latent space. The method, relational GTM, is demonstrated on several benchmarks. 
 Introduction More and more electronic data become available in virtually all areas of life including, for example, biomedical domains, robotics, the web, or multimedia applications, such that powerful data mining tools are needed to support humans to inspect and interpret this information. Also, rapidly increasing technology such as improved sensor technology and advanced methods of data preprocessing and data storage make the data more and more complex, concerning data dimensionality and information content contained in the representation. Therefore, often, a simple comparison of data in terms of the Euclidean norm and a standard representation by means of Euclidean vectors is no longer appropriate to capture the relevant aspects of the data. Rather, dissimilarity measures which are adjusted to the data type and application area at hand should be used, including, for example, alignment distances for genomic sequence analysis in bioinformatics, the compression distance to compare texts, or structure kernels to compare complex graphs and tree structures. Classical data mining tools such as the self-organizing map (SOM) or its statistical counterpart, the generative topographic mapping (GTM) provide a sparse representation of high-dimensional data by means of latent points arranged in a low-dimensional neighborhood structure which is useful for visualization. However, they have been introduced for Euclidean vectors only  [9, 1] . Several extensions of SOM to the more general setting of data characterized by pairwise relations only, have been proposed, including median SOM which restricts prototype locations to data points [10], online and batch SOM using a kernelization of the classical approach [2, 13], and methods which rely on deterministic annealing techniques borrowed from statistical physics  [5] . For GTM, a complex noise model as proposed in  [12]  allows the extension of the method to discrete structures such as sequences. Recently, an intuitive extension of SOM to dissimilarity data has been proposed in [7]  which relies on techniques as introduced in [8]: assume that only a dissimilarity matrix characterizes the data and an explicit vectorial representation is unknown. If prototypes have the special form of convex combinations 277",2010

Some BCM induction protocols have been shown to be compatible with STDP rules, thus combining both forms of plasticity. However, we demonstrate that the majority of actual experimental BCM protocols cannot be reproduced by STDP. This sensitivity to spike protocol is inconsistent with the robust BCM behavior generally found in experiments. Moreover, we show that major recent spike timing rules, despite incorporating rate based effects, cannot replicate actual experimental BCM evidence. Thus, the purported convergence between these two important plasticity phenomena is called in question.",2010

ASkR has been largely studied in the last decades, but in most cases in mono-microphone or microphone array contexts. Our systems are placed in a binaural humanoid context where the signals captured by both ears of a humanoid robot will be exploited to perform the ASkR. Both methods use Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coding (MFCC), but one performs the classification with Predictive Neural Networks (PNN) and the other performs it with Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM).

The algorithm reduces the number of features by taking the probability of producing an unique feature at a specific search depth into account. We observed the probability of generating a non-unique feature depending on a search parameter (which leads to a power-law growths of features) and modeled it by a sigmoid function. This function was integrated into a fingerprinting routine to reduce the features according to their probability. The predictive performance was convincing with a considerable speedup for the training of a linear support vector machine for sparse instances.,2011

These methods are often used in knowledge extraction of multivariate great dimensional data, but very often the number of components is assumed to be known. One of the classical methods to estimate this dimensionality is based on the Principal Components Analysis (PCA) eigenvalues  [1, 2] . However, this method supposes that the model is linear and the signals are Gaussian. To be able to consider non-linear and non-Gaussian cases, we propose in this paper ""measure based methods"" as nearest neighbors dimension and correlation dimension.

Several kinds of signals can be envisioned as well as means to measure them. In this paper we are particularly interested in even-related brain potentials (ERP) and especially visually-evoked potential signals (P300) measured with surface electroencephalograms (EEG). When the human is stimulated with visual inputs, the P300 signals arise about 300 ms after the visual stimulus has been received. Yet, the EEG signal is often very noisy which makes the P300 detection hard. It is customary to use an average of several trials to enhance the P300 signal and reduce the random noise but this results in a lower bit rate of the interface. In this contribution, we propose a novel approach to P300 detection using Kalman filtering and SVMs. Experiments show that this method is a promising step toward single-trial detection of P300.",2011

The optimization problem that we have to solve can be formulated as choosing the linear combination of a priori known matrices such that the smallest singular vector is minimized. This problem has many local minima and can be formulated as a polynomial system which we will solve using a polynomial system solver.

These networks can represent sinusoidal oscillations and their phase, i.e., they can model the binding problem of neuronal assemblies by adjusting the relative phase of the oscillations of different feature detectors. As feature examples, we use color and shape -but the network would also function with any combination of other features. The suggested network architecture performs image generalization but can also be used as an image memory. The information about object color is represented in the phase of the network weights, while the spatial distribution of the neurons codes represent the object's shape. We will show that the architecture can generalize object shapes and recognize object color with very low computational overhead. 
 The Binding Problem Brains are permanently confronted with the problem of classifying objects into meaningful groups, e.g., the object class of ""cars"", even though the objects can be of different size, color, shape. The binding hypothesis is as follows: there are groups of neurons that are sensitive to a certain colors and other groups that react to certain shapes (e.g., typical shapes that are associated with cars). When a human sees a green car, both the neurons responsible for the color green, and those neurons reacting to the car-specific shapes start oscillating. After some time both align their oscillation phase, which means that they react to the same object. Thus, in the perception of the human, the car is associated with the color green.

In order to build a low-dimensional embedding, SNE tries to reproduce the similarities observed in the highdimensional data space. The capability of softmax similarities to fight the phenomenon of norm concentration has been studied in previous work. This paper investigates a complementary aspect, namely, the cost function that quantifies the mismatch between the high-and low-dimensional similarities. We show experimentally that switching from a simple Kullback-Leibler divergences to mixtures of dual divergences increases the quality of DR. This modification brings SNE to the performance level of its Student t-distributed variant, without the need to resort to non-identical similarity definitions in the high-and low-dimensional spaces. These results allow us to conclude that future improvements in similarity-based DR will likely emerge from better definitions of the cost function.",2012

 Complexity and Structural Risk Minimization Let us consider the usual regression framework, consisting of an input set X ⊆ R d and an output set Y ⊆ R, which are related by a fixed but unknown probability distribution μ on X × Y. A series of IID samples (x 1 , y 1 ), . . . , (x n , y n ), where x i ∈ X and y i ∈ Y, is originated from μ and our goal is to find a regression function h : X → R, chosen in a fixed class H, along with a reliable estimate of its performance. For this purpose, a loss function (h(x), y) : R × Y → R is defined, which measures the quality of the regressor. Typical loss functions in the regression framework are the Mean Square Error (MSE), the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) or more sophisticated ones like the Huber's loss. Unfortunately, all the mentioned losses are unbounded, and this represents an issue for several statistical approaches, including both MD and RC  [1, 2] .

Therefore, the use of machine learning techniques for data analysis can be understood as a problem of pattern recognition or, more informally, of knowledge discovery and data mining. There exists a gap, though, between data modeling and knowledge extraction. Models, depending on the machine learning techniques employed, can be described in diverse ways but, in order to consider that some knowledge has been achieved from their description, we must take into account the human cognitive factor that any knowledge extraction process entails.

es2012-88.pdf,RNN based Batch Mode Active Learning Framework,"Gaurav Maheshwari, Vikram Pudi",1 - Centre for Data Engineering IIIT Hyderabad India,"Active Learning has been applied in many real world classification tasks to reduce the amount of labeled data required for training a classifier. However most of the existing active learning strategies select only a single sample for labeling by the oracle in every iteration. This results in retraining the classifier after each sample is added which is quite computationally expensive. Also many of the existing sample selection strategies are not suitable for the multi-class classification tasks. To overcome these issues, we propose an efficient batch mode framework for active learning using the notion of influence sets based on Reverse Nearest Neighbor, which is applicable for multi-class classification as well. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our technique, we compare its performance against existing active learning techniques on real life datasets. Experimental results show that our technique outperforms existing active learning methods significantly especially on multi-class datasets.",2012

We show why the synthesis of logical functions with threshold gates or hardlimit perceptrons is an active research area in VLSI design and nanotechnology and we review some of the methods to synthesize logical functions with a multilayer hardlimit perceptron and we propose the search for an efficient method to synthesize any classification problem with analogical inputs with a two layer hardlimit perceptron as a near future objective.

Hebbian methods became very popular and succesfully in this context. Many nonlinear ICA extensions are known. A promising strategy is the application of kernel mapping. Kernel mapping realizes an usually nonlinear but implicite data mapping of the data into a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. After that a linear demixing can be carried out there. However, explicit handling in this non-Euclidean kernel mapping space is impossible. We show in this paper an alternative using an isomorphic mapping space.

Since information contained within the structure of the data set should not be neglected, our method considers the whole data set during the learning process. In difference to known methods our approach uses neighborhood cooperativeness for stable prototype learning known from Neural Gas. Further improvement of the classification accuracy is achieved by including class border sensitivity inspired by Support Vector Machines again improved by neighborhood learning. 
 Motivation Supervised classification based on labeled data and unsupervised clustering based on unlabeled data are common tasks in the field of machine learning. There exist a variety of algorithms for either paradigm. Some famous clustering methods are c-Means, Self Organizing Maps (SOM), Neural Gas (NG), Affinity Propagation, and variants thereof to improve the performance, consider overlapping data (fuzziness), incorporate neighborhood relations or to attend to sparsity to name just a few. On the other hand there are classifiers like Learning Vector Quantizers (LVQ, GLVQ, RSLVQ etc.) or Nearest Prototype Classifiers (NPC, SNPC, FSNPC etc.) to solve classification problems. Obtaining labeled data sets often is a difficult and costly procedure requiring expert knowledge and -especially if the labelling has to be done manually -a considerable amount of time. Therefore, sometimes only a fraction of a data set is labeled impeding complete classification learning. To utilize the above mentioned methods for this kind of data, either the labels are neglected to do unsupervised clustering or the data set itself is reduced considering only labeled data samples for the classification. In either case, information is lost. For this reason several semi-supervised classification methods namely FLSOM and FLNG  [1]  have been developed for crisp data. These methods closely follow the standard SOM and NG procedures yet also take labeled data into consideration. Pedrycz proposed an alternative semi-supervised vector quantization scheme based on Fuzzy c-Means (FCM)  [2] , but also pays attention to the labeled data samples. For this partially supervised clustering the original FCM cost function is extended by an additional term expressing a level of coincidence between the FCM membership degrees and the expert provided class information  [3, 4] . This way the class information as well as the structure of the data inherent in the whole data set is taken into consideration. Further, special interest frequently is given to the knowledge about decision borders between classes. This problem is explicitly addressed in Support Vector Machine (SVM) learning, which determines so-called support vectors approximating and indicating the borders between the classes  [5, 6] .

Also, mutual information is often used as a criterion to assess the quality of feature subsets, since it can be seen as an imperfect proxy for the risk and can be reliably estimated. In this paper, two different ways to estimate the risk using the Kozachenko-Leonenko probability density estimator are proposed.

The proposed solution is based on self-organizing map for the traveling salesman problem with neighborhoods and it allows to study the exploration formulated as a problem of repeated coverage of the current frontiers where the minimal number of goal candidates is determined simultaneously together with the expected cost to visit the candidates. The early results enabled by the proposed self-organizing map-based solution indicate exploration improvement for the proposed problem formulation.

The proposed algorithm is an extension of the classical algorithm used in Kohonen SOM. It is based on the observation that the quantization error that is a typical quality measure of the learning process, does not decrease linearly along the learning process. One can observe the phases of the increased 'activity', during which the quantization error rapidly decreases, followed by 'stagnation' phases, during which its values are almost the same. The activity phases occur just after decreasing the neighborhood radius, R. A set of finite impulse response (FIR) filters is used to detect both phases. This enables an automatic switching the radius R to a smaller value that shorts a given stagnation phase and starts a new activity phase. Comprehensive investigations carried out by means of the software model of the SOM show that the learning process can be shorten even by 80-95% that allows for reduction of energy consumption even by 70-90%.",2014

 Methods Framework. We assume that a strategic horizon T ∈ N, a state space S, an action space A, a random process p 0 , . . . , p T −1 with values p i ∈ P , a transition function f : S × A × P → S, a reward function r : S × A → R and an initial state s 0 are given.

This means that when we use an error correcting code we cannot control if the number of errors of the received noisy word is greater than the error correction capability of the code of k errors, k=(d-1)/2, where d is the minimum Hamming distance of the code. The main advantage of our proposal results from the introduction of the Retransmit signal when the syndrome decoder detects an ambiguity situation and cannot correct the noisy word. These ambiguity situations occur when happens one more error than the error correction capability of the error correcting code. This property of the error correcting syndrome scheme allows increasing the error correction capability of an error correcting code by one error at a little increment of bandwidth or delay in the transmission. Although there are some proposals of implementation of errorcorrecting decoders with neural networks in literature our work is completely different in what concerns three main aspects. First we propose the implementation of the retransmit signal based on the detection of ambiguity of the minimum Hamming distance between the received word and each of the codewords, i.e. when there are more than one codeword at the minimum Hamming distance to the too noisy received word. Second we use a constructive approach that does not need training. And finally we use hardlimit neurons that can be implemented in hardware by a single transistor in a high gain setup. We begin with two exhaustive simulation experiments where we introduced all manners of occurrence of two errors in all codewords of two codes with minimum Hamming distances 3 and 4, respectively, which only guarantee all possible one error good corrections, to show how the ambiguities arise in the decoding process. Next we present the building blocks of the error correcting decoder based in hardlimit multilayered perceptrons and then we assembled all them out and show an example for an error correcting decoder for a four codewords error correcting code. Finally we discuss the advantages of our proposal and the consequences of the introduction of the Retransmit signal and define possible ways of evolution of our work.",2014

These features are extracted from non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) of mammograms and classified using machine learning classifiers.

Because of its unsupervised nature, clustering methods are often parametric, requiring then some initial parameters. Thus, clustering performance is greatly dependent on the selection of those initial parameters. Furthermore, tuning such parameters is not an easy task when the initial data representation is not adequate. Here, we propose a new projection for input data to improve the cluster identification within a kernel spectral clustering framework.

Still, most of the existing algorithms only work in a centralized manner, i.e. using the whole dataset at once. This paper proposes a parallel filter approach for vertically partitioned data. The idea is to split the data by features and then apply a filter at each partition performing several rounds to obtain a stable set of features. Later, a merging procedure is carried out to combine the results into a single subset of relevant features. Experiments on three representative datasets show that the execution time is considerably shortened whereas the performance is maintained or even improved compared to the standard algorithms applied to the non-partitioned datasets. The proposed approach can be used with any filter algorithm, so it could be seen as a general framework for parallel feature selection.",2014

It relies on an infinite Gaussian mixture model with a Chinese Restaurant Process (CRP) prior, and an eigenvalue decomposition of the covariance matrix of each cluster. The CRP prior allows to control the model complexity in a principled way and to automatically learn the number of clusters. The covariance matrix decomposition allows to fit various parsimonious models going from simplest spherical ones to the more complex general one. We develop an MCMC Gibbs sampler to learn the models. First results obtained on both simulated and real data highlight the interest of the proposed infinite parsimonious mixture model.",2014

There is, however, an implicit constraint stating that the equations of state must be satisfied at every iteration in the optimization process. Such constraints can make a problem highly non-linear and thus difficult to solve. A potential remedy is to reformulate the problem into one in which the parameters and state are treated as independent variables and all constraints appear explicitly. In this paper we compare an implicitly and an explicitly constrained formulation of the same problem. Reported numerical results suggest that the latter is in some respects superior.",2014

The kernel spectral clustering (KSC) method uses a primal-dual framework to build a model on a subgraph of the network. We exploit the structure of the projections in the eigenspace to automatically identify a set of distance thresholds. These thresholds lead to the different levels of hierarchy in the network. We use these distance thresholds on the eigen-projections of the entire network to obtain a hierarchical clustering in an agglomerative fashion. The proposed approach locates several levels of hierarchy which have clusters with high modularity (Q) and high adjusted rand index (ARI) w.r.t. the groundtruth communities. We compare AH-KSC with 2 stateof-the-art large scale hierarchical community detection techniques.,2014

Defining these scores in a first step, independently from the second one, makes this approach not well-suited for large stream data.

2 - SAMM EA 90 rue de Tolbiac 4543, F-75634 Paris Cedex 13 France","Graphs are commonly used to characterise interactions between objects of interest. Because they are based on a straightforward formalism, they are used in many scientific fields from computer science to historical sciences. In this paper, we give an introduction to some methods relying on graphs for learning. This includes both unsupervised and supervised methods. Unsupervised learning algorithms usually aim at visualising graphs in latent spaces and/or clustering the nodes. Both focus on extracting knowledge from graph topologies. While most existing techniques are only applicable to static graphs, where edges do not evolve through time, recent developments have shown that they could be extended to deal with evolving networks. In a supervised context, one generally aims at inferring labels or numerical values attached to nodes using both the graph and, when they are available, node characteristics. Balancing the two sources of information can be challenging, especially as they can disagree locally or globally. In both contexts, supervised and unsupervised, data can be relational (augmented with one or several global graphs) as described above, or graph valued. In this latter case, each object of interest is given as a full graph (possibly completed by other characteristics). In this context, natural tasks include graph clustering (as in producing clusters of graphs rather than clusters of nodes in a single graph), graph classification, etc. 
 Real networks One of the first practical studies on graphs can be dated back to the original work of Moreno [51]  in the 30s. Since then, there has been a growing interest in graph analysis associated with strong developments in the modelling and the processing of these data. Graphs are now used in many scientific fields. In Biology [54, 2, 7] , for instance, metabolic networks can describe pathways of biochemical reactions  [41] , while in social sciences networks are used to represent relation ties between actors  [66, 56, 36, 34] . Other examples include powergrids [71] and the web  [75] . Recently, networks have also been considered in other areas such as geography  [22]  and history  [59, 39] . In machine learning, networks are seen as powerful tools to model problems in order to extract information from data and for prediction purposes. This is the object of this paper. For more complete surveys, we refer to  [28, 62, 49, 45] . In this section, we introduce notations and highlight properties shared by most real networks. In Section 2, we then consider methods aiming at extracting information from a unique network. We will particularly focus on clustering methods where the goal is to find clusters of vertices.

Each arm generates a vector of rewards instead of a single scalar reward. Moreover, these multiple rewards might be conflicting. The M OM AB-problem has a set of Pareto optimal arms and an agent's goal is not only to find that set but also to play evenly or fairly the arms in that set. To find the Pareto optimal arms, linear scalarized function or Pareto dominance relations can be used. The linear scalarized function converts the multiobjective optimization problem into a single objective one and is a very popular approach because of its simplicity. The Pareto dominance relations optimizes directly the multi-objective problem. In this paper, we extend the Thompson Sampling policy to be used in the M OM AB problem. We propose Pareto Thompson Sampling and linear scalarized Thompson Sampling approaches. We compare empirically between Pareto Thompson Sampling and linear scalarized Thompson Sampling on a test suite of M OM AB problems with Bernoulli distributions.

Very popular and recent examples are regularized NMF algorithms. However, these techniques have difficulties to avoid local optima and require high computation times, making them inadequate for large scale data. In this paper, we show that NMF with manifolds regularization on a binary matrix is mathematically equivalent to an edgecut partitioning in a graph augmented with manifolds information in the case of hard co-clustering.

 Motivation Renewable energy integration in electric power systems is progressing at an unprecedented pace, particularly in Europe. The integration of renewable resources, however, poses several challenges to the current paradigm for operating power systems. One major challenge is to mitigate the effects of the unpredictability and volatility of renewable supply, which stems from its strong dependence on weather conditions. Reserves i.e., capacity with the ability to be activated/deactivated in a short time interval, are used to handle uncertainty in power systems operations. They can be procured by flexible generation units and flexible loads in the system. Generally speaking, renewable energy integration drives system operators to increase the reserve margin. The determination of the reserve margin then becomes critical. An overestimation of reserves would result in excess online generation, which is expensive and also undermines the environmental benefits of renewable energy. An underestimation of reserves, on the other hand, can compromise system security. Currently, the process of determining reserves requirements is carried out based on ad-hoc rules, or long-term studies, in most systems. Stochastic programming is a framework that relies on an explicit modeling of uncertainty in optimization problems. When applied to the short-term scheduling of power systems, it endogenously optimizes the required reserves for the time horizon to which it is applied, outperforming ad-hoc rules in the presence of both renewable energy and component failures  [5] . The drawback of stochastic programming is that it requires a probabilistic description of the uncertain parameters, which is usually unavailable and difficult to estimate.

This so-called projectionprediction (PROPRE) architecture is strongly inspired by biological information processing in that it uses a prototype-based, topologically organized hidden layers trained with the SOM learning rule controlled by a global, task-related error signal. Furthermore, the SOM learning adapts only the weights of localized neural sub-populations that are similar to the input, which explicitly avoids the catastrophic forgetting effect of MLPs in case new input statistics are presented to the architecture. As the readout layer uses simple linear regression, the approach essentially applies locally linear models to ""receptive fields"" (RF) defined by SOM prototypes, whereas RF shape is implicitly defined by adjacent prototypes (which avoids the storage of covariance matrices that gets prohibitive for high input dimensionality). Both RF centers and shapes are jointly adapted w.r.t. input statistics and the classification task.

Indeed, available solutions are often slow and fail to provide relevant interpretations. Here we propose a new algorithm to solve this problem of semi-supervised domain adaptation efficiently, by using an adapted combination of transportation algorithms. Our empirical evidence supports our initial intuition, showing the interest of the proposed method. 
 Motivation Statistical learning usually makes the assumption that training and testing data are drawn from the same distribution. Dataset shift occurs when this assumption is violated [for a detailed presentation see 1]. In that case, the problem amounts to finding a transformation that transports data and learned structures from a training domain, toward a test domain. This is the problem of domain adaptation (DA). Our work focuses on a particular case of domain adaptation for supervised learning, when a subset of the target labels is known. This problem is referred as semi-supervised domain adaptation. An interesting solution to semi-supervised domain adaptation has been introduced by Gong et al. [2]  providing state-of-the-art results. Their solution is a kernel-based method that takes advantage of directly exploiting data lowdimensional structures. This approach is also interesting because it facilitates comparisons. Indeed, it focuses only on data domain adaptation, regardless the classifier used to perform the supervised classification task. However, in their approach, dimension reduction used is computationally expensive and leads to the loss of data interpretability. Inspired by  [3] , we propose to address this domain adaptation issue by using an efficient and easy to parallelize optimal transport algorithm, adapted for semi-supervised domain adaptation. Furthermore, our method can be physically interpreted since links between source and target data are explicit. Before presenting our method, some notations have to be introduced. Observed input in the source domain is X s of size n s observations × d variables associated with the probability distribution μ s while Y s ∈ L ns denotes the associated labels, L being the discrete set of all possible labels. Analogously, (X t , Y t ) denote data in the target domain of size n t associated with the probability distribution μ t .",2015

The basic idea behind is the utilization of ordered pairs as a structured input for learning.

It is also used for regression learning, especially in robotics, thanks to its ability to provide a topological projection of high dimensional non linear data. In this case, data extracted from the SOM are usually restricted to the best matching unit (BMU), which is the usual way to use SOM for classification, where class labels are attached to individual neurons. In this article, we investigate the influence of considering more information from the SOM than just the BMU when performing regression. For this purpose, we quantitatively study several output functions for the SOM, when using these data as input of a linear regression, and find that the use of additional activities to the BMU can strongly improve regression performance. Thus, we propose an unified and generic framework that embraces a large spectrum of models from the traditional way to use SOM, with the best matching unit as output, to models related to the radial basis function network paradigm, when using local receptive field as output. * Thomas Hecht gratefully acknowledges funding support by the ""Direction Générale de l'Armement"" (DGA) and École Polytechnique.",2015

To overcome this, we present a gradient-based approach, which simultaneously estimates rewards, dynamics, and the parameterizable stochastic policy of an expert from demonstrations, while the stochastic policy is a function of optimal Q-values.",2016

Two additional advantages are related to the intrinsic probabilistic approach of QML, since quantum states are genuinely probabilistic, and to the capability of finding the global optimum of a given cost function by means of adiabatic quantum optimization, thus circumventing the usual problem of local minima. Another Physics approach for ML comes from Statistical Physics and is linked to Information theory in supervised and semi-supervised learning frameworks.

Treze de Maio Federal Institute of Ceará (IFCE) 2081 Benfica, Fortaleza, Ceará Brazil","Least Square Support Vector Machines (LSSVMs) are an alternative to SVMs because the training process for LSSVMs is based on solving a linear equation system while the training process for SVMs relies on solving a quadratic programming optimization problem. Despite solving a linear system is easier than solving a quadratic programming optimization problem, the absence of sparsity in the Lagrange multiplier vector obtained after training a LSSVM model is an important drawback. To overcome this drawback, we present a new approach for sparse LSSVM called Optimally Pruned LSSVM (OP-LSSVM). Our proposal is based on a ranking method, named Multiresponse Sparse Regression (MRSR), which is used to sort the patterns in terms of relevance. After that, the leave-one-out (LOO) criterion is also used in order to select an appropriate number of support vectors. Our proposal was inspired by a recent methodology called OP-ELM, which prunes hidden neurons of Extreme Learning Machines. Therefore, in this paper, we put LSSVM and MRSR to work together in order to achieve sparse classifiers, as well as one can see that we achieved equivalent (or even superior) performance for real-world classification tasks.",2016

However, both methods use an approximate method for sampling from the model distribution. As a side effect, these approximations yield significantly different biases and variances for stochastic gradient estimates of individual data points. It is well known that CD yields a biased gradient estimate. In this paper we however show empirically that CD has a lower stochastic gradient estimate variance than unbiased sampling, while the mean of subsequent PCD estimates has a higher variance than independent sampling. The results give one explanation to the finding that CD can be used with smaller minibatches or higher learning rates than PCD. 1 Persistent Contrastive Divergence is also known as Stochastic Maximum Likelihood 2 The topic has been covered in e.g. [8], although for a Boltzmann machine with only one visible and hidden neuron. 3 There are however tricks to be able to increase the learning rate of PCD, see e.g.",2016

Deep learning architectures have excelled on such problems due to their ability to combine modality representations at different levels of nonlinear feature extraction. However, designing an optimal architecture in which to fuse such learned representations has largely been a non-trivial human engineering effort. We treat fusion structure optimization as a hyper-parameter search and cast it as a discrete optimization problem under the Bayesian optimization framework.

We thus notice an emergence of tremendous databases, although providing labels to build a training set still remains a very expensive task. In this paper, we tackle the problem of selecting the samples to be labeled in an online fashion. We present an active learning strategy based on query by committee and dropout technique to train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). We evaluate our active learning strategy for CNN on MNIST and USPS benchmarks, showing in particular that selecting less than 22 % from the annotated database is enough to get similar error rate as using the full training set. 
 Introduction The relation between the depth of the architecture, the required amount of training data and the final accuracy of the decision has not only been observed experimentally but it has also been explained in various papers. In their paper [1], Bengio et al. explain clearly that complex decisions can be seen as highly-varying functions and that the decision making algorithm which intends to comprehend all these variations must be composed of many non-linearities. This specificity of deep architectures also impacts the representation compactness of highly-varying functions. In this same paper, they illustrate how deep architectures outperform shallow ones in terms of number of computational units required and thus training samples, in order to represent a given function. Their examples highlight even the differences in representation compactness between deep architectures, with respect to the problem. Considering the huge amount of parameters to be learnt in order to address ImageNet Challenge (60 million parameters for AlexNet, winner in 2012, to reach 152 layers with Microsoft ResNet winner in 2015), one can understand that the training set has to be huge too. Furthermore, in order to better cover the dispersion of the input distribution, strategies to extend the training set have arisen. When considering the difficulty and the cost to gather relevant annotations for Challenges such as ImageNet, the interest for methods working with smaller training sets is increasing. Our work focuses on the selection of a better subset to be annotated for training, exploiting the theory of committee decisions. We propose a low computation adaptation of Query-By-Committee strategy (QBC) for deep learning. Indeed the huge number of parameters to be determined in a deep architecture prevents us from training a committee of deep networks. Instead, we train a full 595",2017

Because of the color similarity between potato-plant diseases, narrow band hyper-spectral imaging is required. Payload constraints on unmanned aerial vehicles require reduction of spectral bands. Therefore, we present a methodology for per-patch classification combined with hyper-spectral band selection. In controlled experiments performed on a set of individual leaves, we measure the performance of five classifiers and three dimensionality-reduction methods with three patch sizes. With the best-performing classifier an error rate of 1.5% is achieved for distinguishing two important potato-plant diseases. 
 Introduction The Netherlands has a leading role in the cultivation and export of seed potatoes, mainly due to their high quality. Monitoring quality and optimizing crop yield are therefore important. Agricultural fields are regularly checked for diseased plants, which are prevented or counteracted using pesticides. Many types of leaf damages can occur, varying from environmental effects [1] to fungal infections. When a disease is incorrectly diagnosed, a wrong treatment could be chosen. For example, pesticides are applied while there is no fungal infection. This could have a negative impact on the environment or even promote resistance to pesticides. Two commonly-confused damages on potato plants are caused by either an Alternaria fungal infection or by exposure to ozone (O 3 ) [2]. Both produce similar brownish lesions on the leaf (Figure  1 ). Alternaria should be treated with pesticides while ozone damage should not. This makes a correct diagnosis important. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are popular for monitoring agricultural fields  [3] . Examples are vegetation index calculation [4], crop recognition [5] and disease detection  [6] . These applications often use commodity multi-spectral cameras which only measure Blue, Green, Red, Red Edge and Near Infrared spectral wavelengths. These sensors are not particularly suitable for detecting subtle color differences in potato leaf lesions because of their broad spectral sensitivity and limited spectral resolution.",2017

Several properties of Fisher memory normalized per state space dimension are derived. In particular, we show that as the system size grows, the contribution of self-coupling of self-loops on reservoir units to the Fisher memory is negligible. Furthermore, we prove that the maximal Fisher memory is achieved when the input-to-state coupling is colinear with the dominant eigenvector of the state space coupling matrix. Finally, we show that when the input-to-state coupling is colinear with the sum of eigenvectors of the state space coupling, the expected normalized memory is four time smaller than the maximal memory value.",2017

es2017-89.pdf,Criticality in Biocomputation,Tjeerd Olde Scheper,1 - Department of Computing Communication Technologies Oxford Brookes University Wheatley Campus OX33 1HX Oxford United Kingdom,"Complexity in biological computation is one of the recognised means by which biological systems manage to function in a complex chaotic world. The ability to function and solve problems irrespective of scale and relative complexity, including higher-order interactions, is essential to the efficacy of biological systems. However, it has been unclear how the required complexity can be introduced to allow these functions to be realised. Nonlinear local interactions are required to combine into a global stable system. The property of criticality, that is exhibited by many nonlinear physical systems, can be exploited to allow local nonlinear oscillators to interact, resulting in a globally stable system. This concept introduces robustness, as well as, a means to control global stability. 
 Criticality The property of physical systems to demonstrate criticality is based on local nonlinear interactions of many small components that contribute to the system [1]. These interactions are not significantly large at the scale of each component, but are contributing factors due to the nonlinear interactions of these components to the global stable state of the system. Criticality is seen in the global state of the system where the system changes state due to its apparent proximity to a critical point. This is often observed as rapid transitions from one state to the next. For example, in the case of a avalanche of snow or sand, where a previously apparent stable state rapidly changes to a different stable state. Similar dynamics have been observed in biological systems, in particular in neural dynamics  [2] . The functional role of criticality is here under investigation. So far, it appears to be mostly related to network complexity and power law relations within those networks. Even though it is still not clear if power law relations are a true property of most systems of interest  [3] , there is certainly a potential for criticality to play an important role in many aspects of biological computation. 
 Nonlinear control Although the concept of criticality has been known for some time now, its exact role and relation to dynamic systems has not yet been determined sufficiently. This can be attributed to the issue of reliably and robustly creating a dynamic system which exhibits criticality. Quite a lot is known about linear systems with relatively complex interactions, however complex interactions in nonlinear systems often quickly degenerate into unstable or chaotic systems. It is argued that biological systems are capable of exerting localised control on the many 323",2017

Score assignment can be done in terms of deviations from normal behavior, where normality is determined by learning a generative model. A general drawback is that the unsupervised learning process often assigns non-intuitive scores. In order to address this problem this paper proposes the usage of interactive concepts, which support the learning process. Interaction thereby strongly utilizes the generative models capabilities to synthesize samples, to give insight into the underlying representation.

A common technique to deal with this problem, called importance weighting, amounts to reweighting the training instances in order to make them resemble the test distribution. However this usually comes at the expense of a reduction of the effective sample size, which is harmful when the initial training sample size is already small. In this paper, we show that there exists a weighting scheme on the unlabeled data such that the combination of the weighted unlabeled data and the labeled training data mimics the test distribution. We further prove that the labels are missing at random in this combined data set and thus can be imputed safely in order to mitigate the undesirable sample-size-reduction effect of importance weighting.

We focus on K-Spectral Centroid (KSC), a k-means-like model, devised for time series clustering. KSC relies on a custom dissimilarity measure between time series, which is invariant to time shifting and Y-scaling. KSC has two downsides: firstly its dissimilarity measure only makes sense for non negative time series. Secondly the KSC algorithm is relatively demanding in terms of computation time. In this paper, we present a natural extension of the KSC dissimilarity measure to time series of arbitrary signs. We show that this new measure is a metric distance. We propose to speed up this extended KSC (EKSC) thanks to four exact optimizations. Finally, we compare EKSC to a similar model, K-Shape, on real world datasets.",2018

Differential privacy has become a powerful principle for privacy-preserving data analysis tasks in the last few years, since it entails a formal privacy guarantee for such settings. This is obtained by a separation of the utility of the database and the risk of an individual to lose his/her privacy. In this contribution, we introduce the Laplace mechanism and a stochastic gradient descent methodology which guarantee differential privacy  [1] .

X say, is an ubiquitous issue. Though easy to state, this predictive problem referered to as ranking median regression (RMR in short) is very difficult to solve in practice. The major challenge lies in the fact that, here, the (discrete) output space is the symmetric group Sn, composed of all permutations of n , of explosive cardinality n!, and which is not a subset of a vector space. It is thus far from straightforward to build (non parametric) predictive rules taking their values in Sn, except by means of ranking aggregation techniques implemented at a local level, as proposed in [1] or  [2] .

In fact, study compares three different base classifiers: linear discriminant analysis (LDA), quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA) and classification and regression tree (CART). Experiments are based on publicly open data set and they show that already a small personal training data set can improve the classification accuracy. Improvement using LDA as base classifier is 4.6 percentage units, using QDA 2.0 percentage units, and 2.3 percentage units using CART. However, if the user-independent model used in the first phase of the recognition process is not accurate enough, personalization cannot improve recognition accuracy. 
 Problem statement and related work This study focuses on human activity recognition based on inertial sensor data collected using smartphone sensors. One of the main challenge of the field is that people are different: they are unique for instance in terms of physical characteristics, health state or gender. All of these have an effect to the data that are collected for model training. In fact, it is shown that user-independent models do not work accurately for instance if they are trained with healthy study subjects and tested with subjects who have difficulties to move  [1] . Thus, if the aim is to train a model that works with everybody, the focus of research should be on personal and personalized prediction models instead of user-independent models. However, the challenge of personal and personalized models is that they require personal training data. This normally would require an extensive, separate data collection session for each user making the approach unusable out-of-the-box. There are some attempts to personalize the recognition process without userinterruption. Siirtola et. al [2] presented a two step approach especially designed for devices that include several different types of sensors. In the first step, userindependent model that uses data from all sensors was used to label personal streaming data. This information is then used to build a light, and energy efficient personal model that uses only a sub-set of available sensors. Using the approach, recognition accuracy can be improved but the problem of the",2018

We use a deep feed-forward neural network trained with load-flows precomputed by simulation. Our architecture permits to train a network on so-called ""n-1"" problems, in which load flows are evaluated for every possible line disconnection, then generalize to ""n-2"" problems without re-training (a clear advantage because of the combinatorial nature of the problem). To that end, we developed a technique bearing similarity with ""dropout"", which we named ""guided dropout"". 
 Background and motivations Electricity is a commodity that consumers take for granted and, while governments relaying public opinion (rightfully) request that renewable energies be used increasingly, little is known about what this entails behind the scenes in additional complexity for Transmission Service Operators (TSOs) to operate the power transmission grid in security. Indeed, renewable energies such as wind and solar power are less predictable than conventional power sources (mainly thermal power plants). A power grid is considered to be operated in ""security"" (i.e. in a secure state) if it is outside a zone of ""constraints"", which includes that power flowing in every line does not exceed given limits. To that end, it is standard practice to operate the grid in real time with the so-called ""n-1"" criterion: this is a preventive measure requiring that at all times the grid would remain in a safe state even if one component (generators, lines, transformers, etc.) were disconnected. Today, the complex task of dispatchers, which are highly trained engineers, consists in analyzing situations and checking prospectively their effect using sophisticated (but slow) high-end simulators. As part of a larger project to assist TSOs in their daily operations [3], our goal in this paper is to emulate the power grid with a neural network to provide fast estimations of power flows in all lines given some ""injections"" (electricity productions and consumptions). 
 The guided dropout method Due to the combinatorial nature of changes in power grid topology, it is impractical (and slow) to train one neural network for each topology. Our idea",2018

In this paper we address the problem of recognizing and anticipating collisions, in order to determine when avoidance manoeuvres are required. We propose and compare two sensor-fusion and neural-network-based solutions, one in which models are trained separately on static and dynamic samples and another in which a model is trained on samples of collisions with both dynamic and static obstacles.

Past research has shown that machine learning may reproduce and even exacerbate human bias due to biased training data or flawed model assumptions, and thus may lead to discriminatory actions. To counteract such biased models, researchers have proposed multiple mathematical definitions of fairness according to which classifiers can be optimized. However, it has also been shown that the outcomes generated by some fairness notions may be unsatisfactory. In this contribution, we add to this research by considering decision making processes in time. We establish a theoretic model in which even perfectly accurate classifiers which adhere to almost all common fairness definitions lead to stable long-term inequalities due to vicious cycles. Only demographic parity, which enforces equal rates of positive decisions across groups, avoids these effects and establishes a virtuous cycle, which leads to perfectly accurate and fair classification in the long term. * Funding by the CITEC center of excellence (EXC 277) is gratefully acknowledged.",2019

The rationale is that locality theoretically guarantees a bound on the generalization error. Each feature in VSC is a max-margin classifier built on randomly-selected pairs of samples. The locality in VSC is achieved by multiplying the value of the feature by a confidence measure that can be characterized in terms of the Chebichev inequality. The output of the layer is then fed in a output layer of neurons. The weights of the output layer are then determined by a regularized pseudoinverse. Extensive comparison of VSC against 9 competitors in the task of binary classification is carried out. Results on 22 benchmark datasets with fixed parameters show that VSC is competitive with the Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP) and outperforms the other competitors.

We propose to define a metric for continuous features based on Lovasz extension of submodular functions, and then present a dedicated metric learning approach.

The spool's end chamber acts somewhat like a Helmholtz resonator whose frequency response changes based on its volume (and therefore spool position). However, nonideal characteristics of the system including wave propagation effects and distributed parameters mean that estimating the volume is more complicated than simply evaluating the resonant frequency.

Assignment kernels are based on an optimal bijection between the parts and have proven to be an effective alternative to the established convolution kernels. We explore how the base kernel can be learned as part of the classification problem. We build on the theory of valid assignment kernels derived from hierarchies defined on the parts.

BOX 4500 FI-90014 Oulu Finland,"In this study, importance of user inputs is studied in the context of personalizing human activity recognition models using incremental learning. Inertial sensor data from three body positions are used, and the classification is based on Learn++ ensemble method. Three different approaches to update models are compared: non-supervised, semi-supervised and supervised. Non-supervised approach relies fully on predicted labels, supervised fully on user labeled data, and the proposed method for semisupervised learning, is a combination of these two. In fact, our experiments show that by relying on predicted labels with high confidence, and asking the user to label only uncertain observations (from 12% to 26% of the observations depending on the used base classifier), almost as low error rates can be achieved as by using supervised approach. In fact, the difference was less than 2%-units. Moreover, unlike non-supervised approach, semisupervised approach does not suffer from drastic concept drift, and thus, the error rate of the non-supervised approach is over 5%-units higher than using semi-supervised approach. 
 Problem statement and related work This study focuses on human activity recognition based on inertial sensor data collected using smartphone sensors. One of the main challenges of the field is that people are different: they are unique for instance in terms of physical characteristics, health state or gender. Due to this, it is shown that a model that provides accurate results for one person, does not necessarily work accurately with somebody else's data. For instance, user-independent models are not accurate if they are trained with healthy study subjects and tested with subjects who have difficulties to move  [1] . Personal recognition models provide better recognition rates, but the challenge is that they normally require personal training data, and therefore, a personal data gathering session  [2] . Our previous study  [3]  presented for the first time how incremental learning can be used to personalize activity recognition models without a separate data gathering session. The advantage of incremental learning is that models can continuously learn from streaming data, and therefore, adapt to the user's personal moving style. In addition, learning can be done without model retraining, instead, models are updated based on streaming data, and therefore, all the training data does not need to be kept stored. In the article, the idea was to base the recognition in the first place in a user-independent model, and use",2019

Designing models that can learn from partially labeled data, or leveraging labeled data in one domain and unlabeled data in a different but related domain is of great interest in many applications. In particular, in this context one can refer to semi-supervised modelling, transfer learning, domain adaptation and multi-view learning among others. There are several possibilities for designing such models ranging from shallow to deep models. These type of models have received increasing interest due to their successful applications in real-life problems.

First, we observe that most adversarial attacks succeed by mounting gradient ascent on the confidence returned by the model, which allows adversary to gain understanding of the classification boundary. Our defenses are based on denying access to the precise classification boundary. Our first defense adds a controlled random noise to the output confidence levels, which prevents an adversary from converging in their numerical approximation attack. Our next defense is based on the observation that by varying the order of the training, often we arrive at models which offer the same classification accuracy, yet they are different numerically. An ensemble of such models allows us to randomly switch between these equivalent models during query which further blurs the classification boundary.

More specifically, a Least-Squares Support Vector Machine (LS-SVM) framework with a time-recursive learning algorithm is evaluated in an application where person presence is estimated based on acoustic signals only. For this purpose, a real-life acoustical dataset of 555 hours was collected in an office environment for the evaluation of the on-edge machine learning framework. 
 Introduction Recent advances in the domain of 'Internet of Things' (IoT) have led to a wide range of off-the-shelf connected devices developed specifically for (indoor) monitoring applications. Today's IoT devices are known to be small, energy efficient and rather cheap allowing unobtrusive integrations in domestic and public environments at a low cost. As the amount of information an IoT device captures is increasing, shifting data processing closer to the sensor becomes more important and is known by 'on-edge processing'. On-edge processing reduces the communication bandwidth and related power consumption, and comes with the advantage that no privacy sensitive data must be transmitted. This work evaluates a machine learning framework based on a Least-Squares Support Vector Machine (LS-SVM) that enables both inference and learning on the network edge where typically only a limited amount of resources are available. For learning, a time-recursive LS-SVM strategy is adopted. This implies that all model parameters are updated in a stepwise manner from small batches of newly collected samples only and thereby reducing the required memory footprint of the embedded platform. The use of IoT-enabled devices to obtain an intelligent behaviour and to facilitate home automation gained a lot of research interest in recent years and is known by 'smart homes'  [1] . Research has shown that residential, public and commercial buildings account for 20% to 40% of the total energy demand in the developed countries  [2] . The main energy consumers are the so-called lighting, heating, ventilation and air conditioning (L-HVAC) systems and are accountable for up to 70% of the total energy consumption  [2] . Reliable presence detection could dynamically control the L-HVAC devices resulting in an overall reduced energy consumption and an improved user comfort.",2020

However, this quantity has many interesting applications, e.g., it can be used to compute the extension complexity of polytopes  [2] . Therefore researchers have been trying to approximate this quantity as closely as possible with strong lower and upper bounds. In this work, we introduce a new lower bound on the nonnegative rank based on a representation of the matrix as a pair of nested polytopes. The nonnegative rank then corresponds to the minimum number of vertices of any polytope nested between these two polytopes. Using the geometric concept of supporting corner, we introduce a parametrized family of computable lower bounds and present preliminary numerical results on slack matrices of regular polygons.",2020

In spite of the outstanding sample quality achieved by those methods, they model the target distributions implicitly, in the sense that the probability density functions approximated by them are not explicitly accessible. This fact renders those methods unfit for tasks that require, for example, scoring new instances of data with the learned distributions. Normalizing flows overcome this limitation by leveraging the change-ofvariables formula for probability density functions, and by using transformations designed to have tractable and cheaply computable Jacobians. Although flexible, this framework lacked (until the publication of recent work) a way to introduce discrete structure (such as the one found in mixtures) in the models it allows to construct, in an unsupervised scenario. The present work overcomes this by using normalizing flows as components in a mixture model, and devising a training procedure for such a model. This procedure is based on variational inference, and uses a variational posterior parameterized by a neural network. As will become clear, this model naturally lends itself to (multimodal) density estimation, semisupervised learning, and clustering.

Despite recent progress, the self-supervised video prediction task is still challenging. One of the critical factors that make the task hard is motion segmentation, which is segmenting individual objects and the background and estimating their motion separately. In video prediction, the shape, appearance, and transformation of each object should be understood only by predicting the next frame in pixel space. To address this task, we propose a novel end-to-end learnable architecture that predicts the next frame by modeling foreground and background separately while simultaneously estimating and predicting the foreground motion using Frequency Domain Transformer Networks. Experimental evaluations show that this yields interpretable representations and that our approach can outperform some widely used video prediction methods like Video Ladder Network and Predictive Gated Pyramids on synthetic data.",2020

However, properties such as control continuity or movement smoothness, which are desirable for application in the real world, will not necessarily emerge from training on reward functions based purely on task success. Inspired by human neuromotor control and movement analysis literature, we define a modular set of costs that promote more efficient, human-like movement policies. Using a simulated 3-DoF manipulator robot, we demonstrate the benefits of these costs by incorporating them into the training of a model-free DRL algorithm and decision-time planning of a trained model-based DRL algorithm.

This is because current data-driven methods work by simply training deep models on large volumes of data and fail to generalize when an unseen table structure is encountered. In this paper, we propose to train a deep network to capture the spatial associations between different word pairs present in the table image for unravelling the table structure. We present an end-to-end pipeline, named TSR-DSAW: TSR via Deep Spatial Association of Words, which outputs a digital representation of a table image in a structured format such as HTML. Given a table image as input, the proposed method begins with the detection of all the words present in the image using a text-detection network like CRAFT which is followed by the generation of word-pairs using dynamic programming. These word-pairs are highlighted in individual images and subsequently, fed into a DenseNet-121 classifier trained to capture spatial associations such as same-row, same-column, same-cell or none. Finally, we perform post-processing on the classifier output to generate the table structure in HTML format.

Experiments show that improvements, collectively called CONNt-SNE, are capable of producing meaningful and trustworthy low-dimensional embeddings without the need to heuristically optimize over (i.e., grid search) t-SNE's perplexity space. Data-driven perplexity determination improves our confidence that any structure appearing in the embeddings is valid and not merely an artifact of spurious parameterization.",2021

As a result, they are labelled as black boxes. In response, several methods have been proposed in the literature to explain their predictions. Among the explanatory methods, Shapley values is a feature attribution method favoured for its robust theoretical foundation. However, the analysis of feature attributions using Shapley values requires choosing a baseline that represents the concept of missingness. An arbitrary choice of baseline could negatively impact the explanatory power of the method and possibly lead to incorrect interpretations. In this paper, we present a method for choosing a baseline according to a neutrality value: as a parameter selected by decision-makers, the point at which their choices are determined by the model predictions being either above or below it. Hence, the proposed baseline is set based on a parameter that depends on the actual use of the model. This procedure stands in contrast to how other baselines are set, i.e. without accounting for how the model is used. We empirically validate our choice of baseline in the context of binary classification tasks, using two datasets: a synthetic dataset and a dataset derived from the financial domain.",2021

However, memory constraints with GPU-based training for memory-intensive deep networks have forced researchers to adopt various workarounds: 1) resize the input image, 2) divide input image into smaller patches, or use smaller batch-sizes in order to fit both the model and batch training data into GPU memory.While these alternatives perform well when dealing with natural images, they suffer from 1) loss of highresolution information, 2) loss of global context and 3) sub-optimal batch sizes. Such issues will likely to become more pressing for domains like medical imaging, where data is scarce and images are often of very high resolution with subtle features. Therefore, in this paper, we demonstrate that training can be made more data-efficient by using a distributed training setup with high-resolution images and larger effective batch sizes, with batches being distributed across multiple nodes. The distributed GPU training framework, which partitions the data and only shares model parameters across different GPUs, gets around the memory constraints of single GPU training. We conduct a study in which experiments are performed for different image resolutions (ranging from 112 × 112 to 1024 × 1024) and different number of images per class to determine the effect of image resolutions on network performance.

5 - UCLouvain.be -IREC/MIRO Avenue Hippocrate 55 B1.54.07 1200 Brussels Belgium","Multidimensional scaling is a statistical process that aims to embed high-dimensional data into a lower-dimensional, more manageable space. Common MDS algorithms tend to have some limitations when facing large data sets due to their high time and spatial complexities. This paper attempts to tackle the problem by using a stochastic approach to MDS which uses gradient descent to optimise a loss function defined on randomly designated quartets of points. This method mitigates the quadratic memory usage by computing distances on the fly, and has iterations in O(N ) time complexity, with N samples. Experiments show that the proposed method provides competitive results in reasonable time. Public codes are available at https://github.com/PierreLambert3/SQuaD-MDS.git. 
 Multidimensional scaling and its limitations Dimensionality reduction (DR) is the process of mapping high-dimensional (HD) observations into a lower-dimensional (LD) space such that the LD embedding is a faithful representation of the HD data. The main DR uses are in machine learning, to curb the curse of dimensionality, and in visualisation. Mapped data can reveal structures that would lay hidden from the human perception if left in HD. Typically, some information is lost by the DR and, therefore, each DR method has a take on what kind of information should be preserved and what can be lost. Used frequently in visualisation, t-SNE [1] aims at retaining the neighbourhood of each point according to a distance metric and a perplexity, which reflects the size of the neighbourhood to preserve. While t-SNE excels at retaining local structures, sufficiently remote points tend to be considered equally distant by the algorithm and, therefore, the larger-scale structures can be distorted. Such distortions can lead to erroneous conclusions by the human user, who might overestimate the dissimilarity between two clusters that are distant in the LD embedding. For this reason, using multiple DR paradigms in conjunction is a good practice in visualisation: another embedding that preserves distances instead of neighbourhoods would have prevented this erroneous conclusion. This paper considers metric multidimensional scaling (MDS): a DR technique that produces a LD embedding such that the pairwise distances in LD reflect those in HD. MDS minimises a cost function which, in its simplest form, is the sum of the squared differences between distances in HD and the Euclidean distances in LD. A common strategy to optimize this cost function is based on 417",2021

Compared to other neuro-symbolic approaches, the proposed method converges to a model that satisfies any inequality constraint on the training data and does not require to first transform the constraints into some ad-hoc term that is added to the learning (optimisation) objective. Under certain conditions, it is shown that CGGD can converge to a model that satisfies the constraints on the training set, while prior work does not necessarily converge to such a model.

3 - SISReC OTRI Osaka University Osaka Japan","Boolean functions (BFs) can be uniquely represented with polynomial functions by representing True and False with ±1. With the 'sign-representation' framework, i.e., when the sign of the polynomials is used instead of the exact ±1, the representation is not unique anymore, and several measures of sign-representation become the target of research. One such measure is the polynomial threshold function density (PTF density), i.e., the minimum number of monomials that suffices to sign-represent a given BF. Several algorithms can find sign-representations with a low number of monomials; however, to find a representation with the minimum number of monomials possible is a combinatorial search problem. The recent success of reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms in solving combinatorial search problems poses the question of whether RL can perform well in finding sign-representations with a low number of monomials. To address this question, we focused on Deep Q-Networks (DQN) and explored its applicability to the sign-representation problem. To be concrete, we present our work on modeling RL agents for solving the signrepresentation problem and give our results on the application of DQN to BFs with a low number of variables (n = 4). Our results indicate that the trained DQN agent generalizes well and exploits intrinsic structure of BFs, such as their equivalence in terms of certain equivalence relations.",2022

Although ensemble methods improve the predictive performance by producing better calibrated confidences, they are computationally expensive. Thus, we propose a real-time capable ensemble method for object detection that significantly improves the performance with only a minor increase in runtime. Our method diversifies the prediction of the class probabilities on the anchor space using multiple classification heads. A regularization further increases the diversity of the heads, making ensemble distillation unnecessary. On the KITTI benchmark dataset, our approach increases the mean average precision of an SSD based network from 0.58 to 0.71. 
 Introduction Deep neural networks (DNNs) are state-of-the-art in many machine learning challenges, outperforming classical methods in computer vision, object detection, and speech recognition  [1, 2] . However, there are still a number of problems when DNNs are used in real-time and safety-critical systems. This includes, for instance, their ability to generalize, as DNNs poorly quantify uncertainty and tend to make overconfident predictions  [3, 4] . Ensemble methods improve the predictive performance of DNNs, providing better calibrated confidences by averaging over the ensemble output  [4] . Ensemble methods can for example be based on a certain number of independently trained networks [5] or a monte-carlo dropout model  [6] . However, these methods significantly increase the computational complexity during inference since multiple forward passes need to be calculated. Therefore, recent work has focused on distilling both the diversity and the knowledge of an ensemble into a single network  [3] . The model used in [3] consists of one network body and multiple networks heads. Thus, it is trained to approximate the predictions of each ensemble member with its corresponding network head. Since the body is shared among all heads, the computational complexity is significantly lower compared to the distilled ensemble. However, the setup used in [3] only works for image classification. Furthermore, training and distilling an ensemble is time-consuming, especially for more complex tasks such as object detection. Therefore, we transfer the multi-head approach to object detection by making two major contributions: We show how to efficiently diversify an anchor-based object detector by using multiple classification heads. In this way, different class probabilities are predicted for each anchor that can be averaged during inference.",2022

A fault of one of these assets may strongly reduce the railway network capacity or even disrupt the circulation. Effectively predicting what assets may need maintenance allows to anticipate the intervention thus avoiding a failure. Currently, this problem is tackled by infrastructure managers mostly relying on operators' experience and with limited support of decision supporting tools. In this paper, we propose a Simple Informed Machine Learning (ML) based model able to automatically predict what asset need to be maintained fully leveraging on the operator experience. However, ML models in modern industrial MLOps pipelines demand continuous data collection, model re-training, testing, and monitoring, creating a large technical debt. In fact, one of the main requirements of these pipelines is to not be regressive, i.e., not simply improve average performances but also not incorrectly predicting an output that was correctly classified by the reference model (negative flips). In this work we face this problem by empowering the proposed ML with Non Regressive properties.

Nor do they gain automatically from algorithmic improvements that have produced efficient matrix inversion and batch training methods. Research has focussed largely on the most extensively studied learning mechanisms in SNNs: spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP).

Despite its inability to provide accurate segmentation across multiple research fields, SAM still serves as a valuable starting point for supporting the segmentation pipeline process, particularly for tasks that require extensive and senior skills annotations. This study aims to evaluate the generalization of SAM and fine-tuning SAM models using three waste segmentation datasets. Although they are captured from real scenes as SAM was pretrained on, these datasets present several challenges, including occlusions, deformable objects, transparency, and objects easily confused with backgrounds. In our findings, the fine-tuned SAM-ViT-H model outperforms the state-ofthe-art Zerowaste, and TACO datasets with a significant increase of +30 in IoU, and it closely approaches performance levels of TrashCan 1.0, with only a −1.44 difference. After evaluating these popular waste datasets, it became evident that fine-tuning SAM as a foundational model is a crucial step for providing better generalization for downstream waste segmentation tasks. Therefore, SAM should not be disregarded or wasted.",2023

In this work, we explicitly tackle this uncertainty by generating multiple possible networks and combining their predictions to improve the quality of the stolen model. For this, we compare five popular uncertainty quantification models in a model stealing task. Surprisingly, our results indicate that the considered models only lead to marginal improvements in terms of label agreement (i.e., fidelity) to the stolen model. To find the cause of this, we inspect the diversity of the model's prediction by looking at the prediction variance as a function of training iterations.

Waste Printed Circuit Boards (WPCBs) constitute significant e-waste and contain valuable components and precious metals. Computer vision systems can automate the classification, disassembly, and recycling of WPCBs. However, obtaining large annotated datasets for machine learning in this domain is costly and often unavailable. This paper investigates using few-shot and supervised contrastive learning in electronic component detection. We propose a model incorporating contrastive learning components for detecting electronic components in scenarios with limited training data or annotated labels. Our experimental results show that, in limited-data scenarios, contrastive learning outperforms the original versions of Faster R-CNN object detector.

Disambiguation of homonyms is one of the functions of mouth actions, making them essential for tasks involving ambiguous hand signs. To measure their importance for ASLR, we trained a classifier to recognize ambiguous hand signs. We compared three models which use the upper body/hands area, the mouth, and both combined as input. We found that the addition of the mouth area in the model resulted in the best accuracy, giving an improvement of 7.2% and 4.7% on the validation and test set, while allowing disambiguation of the hand signs for most of the cases. In cases where the disambiguation failed, it was observed that the signers in the video samples occasionally didn't perform mouthings. In a few cases, the mouthing was enough to achieve full disambiguation of the signs. We conclude that further investigation on the modelling of the mouth region can be beneficial of future ASLR systems.",2023

First, simple models should be preferred to complex ones, in order to prevent overfitting. Second, highdimensional spaces should be avoided, whenever possible, because learning is easier in lower-dimensional spaces. These principles are often invoked to justify methodological choices or to preprocess data. However, this paper shows a counterexample where it is better to first learn a more complex model in a higher-dimensional space, and then to go back to the lowerdimensional space while dropping the additional complexity. Specifically, experiments demonstrate that Gaussian mixtures models can be learned in a higher-dimensional space and then marginalised to the target dimensionality to improve probability density estimation performances.

One of the most common calls is related to requesting an update on the shipment status. Proactively sending message updates to customers can reduce the number of calls. However, naively sending updates to everyone can cause unnecessary anxiety to people who do not want it, thus leading to customer dissatisfaction or even more calls. If a machine learning model could predict shipments leading to a customer call based on its journey, it could be possible to proactively send message updates only to customers likely to make a call. Therefore, reducing the workload in the customer center while increasing customer satisfaction. In large logistic companies where the volume of calls can reach a million calls per month, even 10% of the reduction of calls could already significantly reduce the additional expenses and workload associated with tracing a shipment. In this paper, we formulate the shipment journey as a variant of a language model. Specifically, we treat checkpoints (station, facility, time, event code) as tokens and predict the next checkpoint(station, facility, time delta, event code). Our core insight is that shipment checkpoints follow a set of rules that dictate the possible sequence of checkpoints. This is similar to how grammar rules dictate which words can follow another. Despite remaining a difficult problem, our experiments show that features learned by modeling shipment checkpoints as a language model can improve customer calling prediction.",2023

In this context, there is a gap between purely data-driven models and domain-specific knowledge, requirements, and expertise. In particular, this domain specificity needs to be integrated into the ML models to improve learning generalization, sustainability, trustworthiness, reliability, security, and safety. This additional knowledge can assume different forms, e.g.: software developers require ML to comply with many technical requirements, companies require ML to comply with economic and environmental sustainability, domain experts require ML to be aligned with physical and logical laws, and society requires ML to be aligned with ethical principles. This special session gathers valuable contributions and early findings in the field of Informed ML for Complex Data.

In regular t-SNE, the low-dimensional embedding is initialized either randomly or with PCA; next, gradient descent refines the embedding coordinates in two phases. In the first one, called early exaggeration, attractive forces between points are artificially strengthened to delay any detrimental effect of repulsive forces while points are still poorly organized. In this paper, a novel initialization of t-SNE is proposed. It works by hierarchizing the data points into a space-partitioning binary tree and successive runs of t-SNE with 4, 8, 16, ..., N points. Between two runs, the prototypical point in each tree branch is split into its two children prototypes, with some little random noise, and the embedding is rescaled to account for the increased population.

We address the proper calibration of the predictive uncertainty in regression tasks by employing the probability integral transform (PIT) histogram to diagnose miscalibration.

It also describes the constraints of the competition. The presented machine learning model based on the LightGBM engine stood out from the competition by feeding back the revealed target data given for the previous day and was one of the top 5% of all models in the competition. 
 Introduction On the NASDAQ stock exchange thousands of orders are executed every second, which requires fast and reliable models for bringing buyer and seller together and giving both a competitive price with low spreads compared to other stock exchanges. Especially the last ten minutes of a trading day are characterized by an increased volatility and the closing courses serve as key indicators for many market participants  [1] . While predicting the stock market attracts many researchers, as it promises enormous financial gains, it is also one of the most challenging problems. With the increasing computational power over the lasts decade, researchers were especially successful with supervised learning approaches, like artificial neural networks (ANN) or Support Vector Machines (SVN). But most current models still only have an accuracy between 60% and 80% [2], showing that there is still potential for improvement. Therefore, trading companies and stock exchanges, which especially benefit from having the best predictions, sometimes open competitions for finding better models or new approaches. One of these contests is the Optiver -Trading at the Close challenge 2023  [1] , where we participated in and got in contact with many interesting approaches we want to present in the next chapters.",2024

Each black-box is expensive to evaluate and lacks a closed-form. They use a model of each black-box to guide the search for the problem's solution. Sometimes, however, the black-boxes may be evaluated at different fidelity levels. A lower fidelity is simply a cheap proxy of the corresponding black-box. Thus, lower fidelities that correlate with the actual black-box can be used to reduce the optimization cost. We propose Joint Entropy Search for Multi-Fidelity and Multi-objective Bayesian Optimization with Constraints (MF-JESMOC), a BO method for solving the aforementioned problems. It chooses the next point and fidelity level at which to evaluate the black-boxes as the one that is expected to reduce the most the joint entropy of the Pareto set and the Pareto front, normalized by the fidelity's cost.

Many applications allow for some errors to be made, although, traditional learning objectives will influence the training in all cases except the one perfect prediction is made. In this work, constraints are proposed to replace the cross-entropy or the mean squared error to allow the neural network to make some errors. These errors can be set in advance to reflect how accurate the predictions of the neural network need to be.

The idea is to train a network by maximizing the correlation between corresponding features and minimizing the correlation between non-corresponding features in distorted views of the same image, through this facilitating effective pretraining of a backbone network for a subsequent classification head. This is achieved by diagonalizing the cross-correlation matrix of the network's representations and scaling it towards the identity matrix. We show that the cross-correlation matrix of distorted images is inherently symmetric, independent of the backbone network's weights, which leads to two key insights: (i) the cross-correlation matrix can always be diagonalized using a linear transformation (layer), and (ii) the core idea of maximizing correlations between corresponding features while minimizing them for non-corresponding features alone is insufficient for effective backbone network pretraining. Nevertheless, Barlow Twins provide highly effective pretraining. We show that this is due to the normalization of the cross-correlation matrix in the Barlow Twins cost function.

A naive online learning strategy fails due to the catastrophic forgetting phenomenon. Previous literature introduced the 'latent replay' for CL at the edge, where the input is transformed into latent representations using a pre-trained feature extractor. These latent representations are used, in combination with the real inputs, to train the adaptive classification layers. This approach is prone to the stability gap problem, where the accuracies of learned classes drop when learning a new class, and they only recover during subsequent training iterations. We hypothesize that this is caused by the class imbalance between new class data from the new task, and the old class data in the replay memory. We validate this by applying two class balancing strategies in a latent replay-based CL method. Our empirical results demonstrate that class balancing strategies provide a notable accuracy improvement, and a reduction of the stability gap when using a latent replay-based CL method with a small replay memory size.",2025

Stochastic neighborhoods are less sensitive than distances to statistical variations between spaces with strongly different dimensionalities, making a match across them very difficult. Here, we take inspiration from those stochastic neighborhoods in order to devise a pseudo-distance that is less prone to concentration than the Euclidean distance. For two points in the high-dimensional data space, it is defined as the symmetrized Kullback-Leibler divergence across the (stochastic) neighborhoods of the two points (SKLAN). Plugging the SKLAN in a method of stress-based MDS, we compare quantitatively t-SNE, MDS with all Euclidean distances, and MDS with SKLAN & Euclidean distances on several data sets. The results show that SKLAN allows MDS to perform competitively with t-SNE. 
 Dimensionality reduction and motivation Dimensionality reduction (DR) aims at representing high-dimensional (HD) data with low-dimensional (LD) embeddings, in which salient features of data are preserved or even highlighted. Such features can be for instance variance in principal component analysis (PCA)  [1] , distances in multidimensional scaling (MDS)  [2] , or similarities in neighbor embedding (NE)  [3] . Most of the current, state-of-the-art methods of DR stem from the family of neighbor embedding, with stochastic neighbor embedding (SNE)  [4]  as their common but forgotten ancestor. The celebrity in the family remains undoubtedly t-SNE [5], probably because of its capability to amplify cluster gaps in the embeddings, on top of overall good performance at DR. Neighbor embedding in general and t-SNE in particular have dusted previous paradigms of DR, and notably so for MDS. Stress-based MDS consists in finding embedding coordinates such that LD distances match those in HD  [2] . In contrast, NE determines the embedding by",2025

However, MPNNs are known for their lack of expressiveness as they are bounded by the firstorder Weisfeiler-Lehman test. In this paper, we use higher-order GNNs to tackle the metric learning problem and show on benchmark datasets how they can improve performance by using a node-level strategy and the Wasserstein distance. 
 Introduction A key challenge in modeling structured information with graphs lies in computing the distances between them. The Graph Edit Distance(GED)[4] is a state-ofthe-art method for this purpose; however, it suffers from NP-hard complexity. Recently, several architectures have been proposed to address this limitation  [9, 7, 8, 11, 12]  in a learning framework. These architectures generally consist of two main components. The first is an embedding block that uses siamese Graph Neural Networks(GNNs) to embed graphs either at the graph level or at the node level. The second component is a metric block that takes the embeddings generated by the first block as input and computes the distance between graphs, taking into account the embedding level. The rationale behind these architectures is that the embedding block learns an optimal representation to facilitate the computations in the metric block. To the best of our knowledge, existing embedding blocks in the literature rely on simple yet effective Message Passing Neural Networks(MPNNs), such as GCN [3]  or GIN  [2] . Consequently, they suffer from the well-known limitations of MPNNs, including over-smoothing, over-squashing, and limited expressive power. This last limitation is particularly significant for metric learning, as it affects the ability to generate distinct embeddings for different graphs. Yet, GCN and GIN models have been shown to be at most equivalent to the firstorder Weisfeiler-Lehman(WL) test in the WL hierarchy  [1] . Recently, more expressive GNNs such as PPGN [5]  and G 2 N 2 [6] have been introduced in the literature, achieving a 3-WL expressivity level. To attain this level of expressivity, these architectures naturally incorporate edge embeddings, adding valuable information to the traditional node-and graph-level representations. These recent developments raise two research questions: how can 3-WL GNNs be integrated into a metric learning framework, and do they enable improved performance? 283",2025

Our preliminary results show that the dynamics are able to recover the GradCAMs on noisy images, providing promising avenues for future work aiming to understand the role of recurrence.",2025

2 - Department of Information and Computer Science","Text representation is a key component in the performance of any hypernymy-related task. In this study, we investigate representation techniques to understand which features best represent the hypernymy relation, focusing on three factors of representation: word embedding, embedding combination techniques, and using features. The results indicate that different embeddings have different effects on performance; concatenation, 'addition and subtraction' have led to better performance, and using unsupervised measures has a negative effect on performance.",2025

This article presents a study that involves the prediction, using multi-class classification models, of several human standard emotions from facial expressions. It is based on a publicly available dataset for emotion recognition that includes socio-demographic information and psychiatric profiles of individuals with mental illnesses. The study aims to explore how effectively these models can identify and classify emotions based on facial cues, considering the diverse psychiatric backgrounds of the subjects. It also aims to investigate to what extent the severity of the psychiatric condition affects the level of certainty of the predictions.",2025

In particular, data with complex internal structure like emission spectra need to be adapted to reduce the encoding effort of quantum circuits. We empirically investigate the influence of compression on the encoding of hyperspectral data into quantum states, to make its encoding more efficient. To this end, we assess the effect of approximating states by low-bond dimension matrix product states fed into a variational quantum classifier on the public Pavia University benchmark dataset.",2025

2 - Groningen Cognitive Systems and Materials Center (CogniGron) University of Groningen Groningen The Netherlands","Using the statistical physics framework, we study the online learning dynamics in a particular case of shallow feed-forward neural networks with ReLU activation. By expanding the activation function in terms of Hermite polynomials we derive analytical results for the evolution of order parameters for any learning rate. Moreover, we compare our results with online gradient descent simulations and show how our method describes the typical learning curves. We also present results on how the learning rate affects the overall behavior of the network and its equilibria, showing different learning regimes and critical values of the learning rate. * This work is funded by NWO M1 grant OCENW.M20.287 and the Groningen Cognitive Systems and Materials Center (CogniGron).",2025

We investigate dynamic sparsity in attention mechanisms, using the OPT model as a case study. We explore the dynamic nature of redundancy in attention heads and analyze which components of the model provide sufficient information to predict sparsity effectively. Our findings highlight the norm of attention outputs as a reliable criterion for ranking head importance. We systematically evaluate embeddings across layers and time steps, showing that dynamic sparsity predictions can be achieved early in the model pipeline with minimal loss in accuracy. By elucidating the mechanisms underlying dynamic sparsity, this work lays a foundation for more efficient and scalable transformer models. * RS is funded by BMBF project EVENTS (16ME0733).

However, out-of-the-box, they do not manage to correctly integrate and interpret these components as a whole. One way to alleviate this weakness is to expand the network with explicit knowledge and a separate reasoning component. In this paper, we evaluate an approach to this end, applied to the solving of the popular board game Rummikub. We demonstrate that, for this particular example, the added background knowledge is equally valuable as two-thirds of the data set, and allows to bring down the training time to half the original time.",2025

However, translating the machine learning models from labs to patient's everyday lives remains a challenge due to various disturbances, such as electrodes shifts. To mitigate the influence of electrode shifts, we investigate two linear domain adaptation methods and a robust training approach. In experiments, we compare all methods on both simulated electrode shifts on the Ninapro DB2 data set as well as real electrode shifts on Ninapro DB8. We find that linear domain adaptation could estimate the shift and reduce the impact of electrodes shift best, but robust training approaches similar performance without the need for new data.",2025
